# Project - 1: Netflix Data Analysis with Python

<p>The dataset I use for the Netflix data analytics task consists of TV shows and movies streamed on Netflix as of 2019.
  The dataset is provided by **[Flixable](https://flixable.com/)** which is an engine of third-party research available on Netflix.</p>

## Objectives of this project
<ol>
  <li>Understand what content is available</li>
  <li>Understand the network between actors and directors</li>
  <li>What exactly Netflix is focusing on</li>
  <li>Sentiment analysis of content available on Netflix.</li>
</ol>
