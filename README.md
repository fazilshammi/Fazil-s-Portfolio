# Project - 1: [Netflix Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/fazilshammi/Fazil-s-Portfolio/blob/3c6865ddd422d6a2b243af241f25e30567dad65c/Netflix_Project.ipynb)

The dataset I use for the Netflix data analytics task consists of TV shows and movies streamed on Netflix as of 2019.
The dataset is provided by [flixable](https://flixable.com/) which is an engine of third-party research available on Netflix.

## Objectives of this project
<ol>
  <li>Understand what content is available</li>
  <li>Understand the network between actors and directors</li>
  <li>What exactly Netflix is focusing on</li>
  <li>Sentiment analysis of content available on Netflix.</li>
</ol>
